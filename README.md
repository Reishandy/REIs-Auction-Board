# REI's Auction Board

Welcome to REI's Auction Board, a showcase of a web application simulating an online auction platform for in-game items. This project provides a glimpse into the features and implementation of a user-friendly interface for posting items, bidding, and managing auction entries. The application is built using PHP and MySQL to handle the backend functionalities.

## Access the Simulated Auction Board
Explore the simulated auction experience by visiting [REI's Simulated Game Auction](https://www.reisauctionboard.rf.gd/).

## Features

### Auction Display
The main page features a dynamic table showcasing auction entries, including essential details such as item name, tier, minimum bid, current bid, and end date. Users can easily navigate through available auctions.

### User Authentication
To ensure a secure environment, users are required to log in. Unauthorized access redirects users to the login page.

### Auction Management
Authenticated users can post new items for auction, remove their own entries, and update auction end dates. The system checks bid validity, ensuring that the bid amount surpasses both the current bid and the minimum bid.

### Responsive Design
The web application is designed to be responsive, delivering a seamless experience across various devices.

## Technologies Used

### Bootstrap 5
Utilized for styling and creating a responsive design, enhancing the visual appeal of the simulated auction interface.

### Google Fonts (Skranji)
The "Skranji" font from Google Fonts is incorporated to provide a unique and visually appealing text style.

## Showcase
This project is a demonstration of my ability to create dynamic web applications, implement user authentication, and interact with databases to simulate real-world scenarios such as a game item auction.

## Notes
This is a simulated project created for portfolio purposes, and there is no real auction or monetary transactions involved.

**Disclaimer:** The items and bids in this simulation are fictional and do not represent actual products or values.

Feel free to explore and experience the simulated game auction!
